One-JAR Overview
----------------
One-JAR allows you to package a Java application inside a single 
Jar file, while preserving any supporting library Jar files intact, 
under a "lib" directory.  Preserving library Jar files may avoid 
violating the license terms for redistribution of those Jar files. 

Use of One-JAR should be transparent to your application, unless it uses
a non-delegating classloader in which case you will need to implement
a One-JAR classloader wrapper.  For more information please visit
http://one-jar.sourceforge.net (below).
    
Make sure to include both class and resourc files in your One-JAR file.

Option          Type       	 Purpose 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One-JAR         Checkbox     Builds a One-JAR archive, an executable JAR file 
                             with supporting libraries under lib, and the main 
                             archive under main/main.jar 
					
                             Run the archive in the same way as a FatJar archive: 
                             java -jar archive.jar

One-Jar-Expand  String       A list of files/directories from the One-JAR archive 
                             to be expanded into the filesystem when the One-JAR 
                             archive is executed.   This is useful if your
                             application relies on having certain files present
                             in the file-system, rather than loading them as
                             resources.
